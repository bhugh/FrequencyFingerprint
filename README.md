# FrequencyFingerprint
Take MIDI or audio files and make a Frequency Fingerprint of the music (analysis; music theory) - calc average pitch, most common pitch, etc

The code is implemented in python on Google Colab Notebooks, which you can view and run here:

* MIDI, runnable release version: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_KuXcZ9VKcA4Ou5H9VVfVvgdeMLGzO1u?usp=sharing
* MIDI, most current version: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_KuXcZ9VKcA4Ou5H9VVfVvgdeMLGzO1u?usp=sharing (can be copied to your own Colab Notebook to run or edit)

* Audio File, most current version: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ai3X9QErw4OvJ1RHZs2jn6AZ-0RVh8yc?usp=sharing (can be copied to your own Colab Notebook to run or edit)

The wiki has articles with more information about the idea of Frequency Fingerprints, how to run the software, and example analysis of music using the Fingerprints:
